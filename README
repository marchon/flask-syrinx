    ~ What is Syrinx?

      A SQLite and Flask powered distributed twitter clone

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the __init__.py file or
         export an SYRINX_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. fire up a python shell and run this:

         >>> from syrinx import init_db; init_db()

      3. now you can run the syrinx.py file with your
         python interpreter and the application will
         greet you on http://localhost:5000/

    ~ Is it tested?

      You betcha.  Run the `syrinx_tests.py` file to
      see the tests pass.
